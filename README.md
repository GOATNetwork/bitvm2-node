# GOAT Bitvm2 Node

A universal node for Operator, Challenger and Covenant Signer.

## Tutorial

See [Node](node/README.md).

## Roles

There are three main roles in this protocol, Committee, Operator, Challenger and Relayer.

| Role       | Functions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Committee  | N-of-n signers for the presign transactions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Operator   | Anyone can be an operator. <br>1. Exchange PeggleBTC to native BTC with users <br>2. Kickoff the reimbursement from Committee <br> 3. Generate the preimage of the hash time lock to each watchtower <br>4. Exchange PegBTC to BTC with end-user via AtomicSwap                            |
| Challenger | Anyone can be a challenger <br>1. Verify the valid of the reimbursement from operators offchain <br>2. Submit the challenge transaction on Bitcoin to force the kick off to unhappy path                                                                                                   |
| Watchtower | A special kind of challenger, selected from the Sequencer candidates, maintains the longest chain headers and spends the Watchtower output of the Kickoff transaction.                                                                                                                     |
| Verifier   | Another kind of challenger. Once the kickoff is on the unhappy path, and the operator unveils all the execution trace(Circuit F below), verify finds the flow in the execution trace, and can spend the UTXO from Assert transaction, and stop the operator to continue the reimbursement. |
| Relayer    | Operated by official nodes.<br>1.Provide bootnode services  <br>2 Supports asset transfer services between Layer 1 and Layer 2 of the BTVM2 system, including tracing L1 txn; calling and monitoring L2 gateway contract <br>3 Starting pegin processing.                                  |                                                                    |

## Node

### Run a node

```bash
./target/debug/goat-bitvm2-node
```

It should print out the address to listen on.

In another console, run

```bash
./target/debug/goat-bitvm2-node --bootnodes /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/50022
```

Replace the peer address with above.

#### Operation

**Requirement**

Committee Member: need approval from all committee members

Challenger: anyone can be a challenger

Operator: anyone who holds PegBTC can be an operator

**Operation**

1. Generate identity
2. Configure the bootnode and launch the node

**Unjoin**

#### Identity and Authentication

Generate the identity by cli.

P2P: ed25519

Committee n-of-n: musig2 (secp256k1)
